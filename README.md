# Zoo
Model a ZOO keeping in mind that:

- A zoo has a name and a list of animals
- At a zoo they can bring new animals and transfer animals to new zoos
- At a zoo the animals are daily fed with their favorite food, and each animal eats what it loves to eat.
- Each animal knows to eat by itself, and not all animals of the same type prefer the same type of food. Eg; a horse prefers carrots, and another horse prefers apples
